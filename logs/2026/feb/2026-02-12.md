## 🔍 Code Analysis

### BoltMVP Repository Storage Analysis

**Repository**: `/Users/abishchhetri/boltmvp`
**Analyzed**: 2026-02-12

#### Current Storage Architecture

| Storage Type | Data Stored | Purpose |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **localStorage** | `caplyst_cases`, `caplyst_parties`, `caplyst_tasks`, `caplyst_timeline`, `auth_token`, `auth_user` | Structured workflow data, authentication |
| **IndexedDB** | `caplyst_artifacts_db` (file blobs), `caplyst_audit_logs` | Large file storage + audit trail |

#### Why Local Storage Only?

This is an **MVP/Prototype** with intentional design choices:

1. **Rapid Development** - No backend infrastructure needed
2. **Offline Capability** - Users can work without internet
3. **Zero Cost** - No server/database costs during development
4. **Instant Performance** - No network latency

#### Key Findings

- **API-Ready Architecture**: All services (`caseService`, `artifactService`) abstract storage access but currently point to localStorage
- **External Services**: Only `@betterbugs/web-sdk` for bug reporting is actively integrated
- **Mock Payment**: Razorpay mentioned in comments but not implemented
- **Document Processing**: Client-side PDF processing with `pdfjs-dist`

#### Production Requirements

| Current (Local) | Production Will Need |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| localStorage | PostgreSQL/MongoDB |
| IndexedDB | AWS S3/Cloud Storage |
| Token in localStorage | OAuth/Auth0 |
| No real-time sync | WebSockets/Socket.io |
| No multi-device access | Cloud backend |

#### Security Concerns

- No encryption of stored data
- Tokens in localStorage (XSS vulnerable)
- No session expiration logic
