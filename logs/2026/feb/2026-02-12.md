## 🔍 Code Analysis

### BoltMVP Repository Storage Analysis

**Repository**: `/Users/abishchhetri/boltmvp`
**Analyzed**: 2026-02-12

#### Current Storage Architecture

| Storage Type | Data Stored | Purpose |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **localStorage** | `caplyst_cases`, `caplyst_parties`, `caplyst_tasks`, `caplyst_timeline`, `auth_token`, `auth_user` | Structured workflow data, authentication |
| **IndexedDB** | `caplyst_artifacts_db` (file blobs), `caplyst_audit_logs` | Large file storage + audit trail |

#### Why Local Storage Only?

This is an **MVP/Prototype** with intentional design choices:

1. **Rapid Development** - No backend infrastructure needed
2. **Offline Capability** - Users can work without internet
3. **Zero Cost** - No server/database costs during development
4. **Instant Performance** - No network latency

#### Key Findings

- **API-Ready Architecture**: All services (`caseService`, `artifactService`) abstract storage access but currently point to localStorage
- **External Services**: Only `@betterbugs/web-sdk` for bug reporting is actively integrated
- **Mock Payment**: Razorpay mentioned in comments but not implemented
- **Document Processing**: Client-side PDF processing with `pdfjs-dist`

#### Production Requirements

| Current (Local) | Production Will Need |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| localStorage | PostgreSQL/MongoDB |
| IndexedDB | AWS S3/Cloud Storage |
| Token in localStorage | OAuth/Auth0 |
| No real-time sync | WebSockets/Socket.io |
| No multi-device access | Cloud backend |

#### Security Concerns

- No encryption of stored data
- Tokens in localStorage (XSS vulnerable)
- No session expiration logic

*This is the first automated daily log. Data will be more comprehensive tomorrow.*

## 🔍 Code Analysis - Extended Session

### BoltMVP Repository - Complete Understanding

**Session**: 2026-02-12 (Deep Dive - Part 2)

#### 1. Complete Project Structure

```
boltmvp/src/
├── components/      # 28 React components (UI, layout, shared)
├── contexts/       # React Context (Auth, Theme)
├── hooks/          # Custom hooks (useDarkMode, useDraftCaseId, etc.)
├── lib/            # 36 files - API services + configs + utils
├── models/         # 8 data models (case, party, artifact, task, etc.)
├── pages/          # 15 pages (agent, company, draft, home)
├── utils/          # 6 utility files
├── App.tsx         # Main Router
├── main.tsx        # Entry Point
└── types.ts        # Shared Types
```

**File Count**: ~150+ source files

#### 2. Workflow Deep Dive

**Authentication Flow**:
```
Login → Email → OTP verify → Stores: auth_token, auth_user →
  Redirect: No cases? /draft/company-type
           Past draft? /overview
           In draft? Resume from last step
```

**State Machine** (11 states):
```
DRAFT → PAYMENT → CLIENT_REVIEW_EDIT → VERIFICATION →
NAME_APPROVAL → INCORP_PREP → PRE_FILING →
FILED_FOR_INCORPORATION → INCORPORATED
(REWORK_REQUIRED loops back)
```

**Dual Portal**:
- Founder Hub (/overview) - Dark theme, review/parties/artifacts/questions
- Agent Console (/agent) - Light theme, specialty tabs per state

#### 3. API Simulation - Intentional Design

**Core Pattern** - `ApiResponse<T>` + `withApiErrorHandling`:
```typescript
// Simulates real API responses
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: { code: string; message: string };
}

// Wraps operations with try-catch
async function withApiErrorHandling<T>(
  operation: () => T,
  errorMessage: string
): Promise<ApiResponse<T>>
```

**Why This Design**:
- Frontend calls API services → Services call storage
- Same `ApiResponse` contract as real API would use
- Easy migration: swap storage for `fetch()` later

#### 4. Alignment with Plans/Docs

| Requirement (plans) | BoltMVP | Status |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| Dual Portal | ✅ Founder + Agent | ✅ Match |
| State Machine (FSM) | ✅ State transitions with guards | ✅ Match |
| Event Sourcing | ✅ State + Timeline events | ✅ Match |
| Service Layer | ✅ API service layer | ✅ Match |
| Clean Architecture | ✅ Component → API → Storage | ✅ Match |
| Type Safety | ✅ TypeScript interfaces | ✅ Match |
| Task Auto-Creation | ✅ `autoCreateTasksForState()` | ✅ Match |

**Missing**:
- ❌ XState machines (uses React Router)
- ❌ TanStack Query (direct service calls)
- ❌ Connect RPC (mock wrapper)
- ❌ PostgreSQL (localStorage)

#### 5. Entrepreneur Portal Requirements

**Missing Pages**:
- ❌ Form Review page (`/case/:caseId/form`)
- ❌ Certificates page (`/case/:caseId/certificates`)
- ❌ Account page (`/account`)

**Missing Components**:
- ❌ DatePicker, Select dropdown
- ❌ Sidebar navigation
- ❌ CaseStatusDisplay (FSM-based)
- ❌ ErrorBoundary, NetworkErrorFallback

**Key Insight**: BoltMVP is a **functional prototype** validating architecture before full-stack investment.
